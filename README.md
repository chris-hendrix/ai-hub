# AI Hub

A centralized repository for AI development tooling and configurations.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a hub for:

- **Shared Claude Code Configurations**: Reusable `.claude` folder contents (commands, prompts, hooks) that can be used across multiple projects
- **MCP Server Management**: Centralized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations using [Docker MCP Toolkit](https://docs.docker.com/ai/mcp-catalog-and-toolkit/toolkit/)

## Getting Started

This repository is in its initial setup phase. Documentation will be expanded as components are added.
